## How to run Locally

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

**_NOTE:_** This command should start both the backend (Firebase Functions) and the frontend (React App). Since the local environment is using the Firebase emulator, it might take a few seconds until all the services (Auth, Firestore and Functions) are ready to use. It might be necessary to refresh the page a couple of times in order to be able to use the whole app normally.

## How to run migrations

```shell
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/firestore-service-account.json"" npm run migrate
```
